Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to transform raw purchase and shipping data into actionable insights through an interactive and visually appealing dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. It helps track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to total costs, order volumes, shipping times, and vendor performance over the 2023-2024 period. 
Key Features
Interactive Slicers: Dynamically filter data by year (2023, 2024), month, product category, supplier/vendor, shipping mode (Air, Sea, Truck, Rail), and location/region.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Prominent display of summary metrics such as total orders, total purchase value/cost, total quantity ordered, average shipping time, on-time delivery percentage, and overdue payment percentage.
Data Visualization: Uses various charts (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts, progress bars) to illustrate trends and comparisons clearly.
Multiple Analysis Pages: Includes dedicated pages for:
Overview: High-level summary of all key metrics.
Vendor Analysis: Performance tracking by supplier.
Shipping Analysis: Breakdown by transport mode, cost, and transit times.
Product/Category Analysis: Insights into item-wise performance.
Dynamic Updates: The entire dashboard updates automatically when new data is entered into the source sheet and the "Refresh All" function is used.
User-Friendly Navigation: Navigation buttons allow seamless movement between the different analysis pages. 
Technical Requirements
Microsoft Excel (Office 365 or a recent version is recommended for full functionality).
Basic Excel knowledge to update data. 
How to Use the Dashboard
Open the file: Open the Purchase_Shipping_Analysis_Dashboard_2023_2024.xlsx file.
Enable Macros/Content (if prompted): Click "Enable Content" if you see a security warning banner to ensure all interactive features and navigation work correctly.
Navigate: Use the navigation buttons on the left sidebar to switch between the Overview, Vendor Analysis, Shipping Analysis, and Category Analysis pages.
Filter Data: Use the slicers (located on the right or left of the pages) to filter the data by relevant criteria (e.g., select "2024" to see only 2024 data).
Refresh Data: After entering new data into the Data sheet, go to the Data tab and click Refresh All to update all pivot tables and charts.
